# Building the Frontend

## Dev Level Build
Here, we basically describe how we are going to run the frontend app in dev mode.

## Start node server
Since we are using `yarn`, you should go inside `react-app` directory
```bash
yarn install # If you do not install the packages
yarn start
```
After the build, the frontend app is available at: http://0.0.0.0:3000
